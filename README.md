# RoboNeko

![Screenshot](logo.png?raw=true "Screenshot showing a happy Robit")

The classic Neko applet for X11, now with more robot! Written in C++ with SDL2.
Due to limitations with SDL the robot is confined to the window.


## Build Instructions

The only dependency is SDL2. To build with CMake:


    ````
    cd RoboNeko
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ````
