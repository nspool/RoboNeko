# RoboNeko

![Screenshot](logo.png?raw=true "Screenshot showing a happy Robit")

The classic Neko applet for X11, now with more robot!

Written in C++ with SDL2. The provided project is Xcode 8, but doesn't require any macOS dependencies.

# TODO

- Robot should celebrate when it reaches the mouse cursor
- Add an impatient robot state for when it's bored
